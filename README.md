# Impacts on Society

**My course, Computer Science, is a high school 9-12th grade computer science course where students learn coding in Java and principles of computer science. This document is going to detail 3 aspects of my course that will help students become self-evaluative regarding the helps and harms of computer science projects.  The first is learning about them and taking an assessment.  The second is creating a class rubric that can be used to score apps and projects for their impact on society.  The third is using that rubric to score popular apps and games and also to self-evaluate each project they create before they submit it.**


## Plan

### Learning Objectives

* Students will be able to identify and name positive and negative impacts of computing in society including harm/health and inclusivity.

* Students will critique their own work and the work of others in light of the above topics.

* Students will create projects that adhere to positive societal impacts.

### Learning Activities

After learning about inclusivity, direct harms (like cyberbullying) and indirect harms (like incentivizing addictions) students will take an assessment as needed asking them to identify some of the positive and negative types of influences from computing.

Students will work together through research and class discussion to create a rubric of ideals that each student will be able to reference as they create or design projects.  This rubric will serve to allow students to self-reflect on their own work, and provide a set of central values that the class holds regarding inclusivity and impacts of what computer scientists do.  

This will be a one time activity at the beginning of the course after students have been introduced to some of the positive and negative things computing has had a hand in doing.  However, if the class learns more throughout the course, or comes up with things that should have been included, or have been determined to be too vague, the class can revisit it, or individual students can create their own edited copy for personal use.

After the rubric is created, students will apply their rubric to some common apps and implementations.  After grading them individually, students will pair up and defend or change their positions and then as a class, pairs will share their results to see how different they all were.  This can be a great activity to reinforce the fact that different people will see different things, and that we should get feedback from many different sources to make sure we have seen all the perspectives.  This can also be an opportunity for students to discuss bias, and what kinds of biases different types of people might have.

After each project the students create, they will be encouraged to rate themselves against the rubric that the class has made.  They can include a reflection or self-assessment with their projects. Part of the points from each project will come from its rating on the class rubric.

### Assessment

Students' progress toward the goals will be graded in a few different ways.  They will be given a test/quiz grade based on the assessment mentioned above, to make sure that everyone understood the general foundation of impact goals for the class.

For the creation of the rubric, students will not be graded, but different ways to encourage full participation will be employed.  Using think-pair-share, more students will be able to share suggestions, even if many of them have the same ideas within their pairs.  Random name drawing could also be employed to get more students talking.  Some lower level topics, such as saying a complement or criticism of another students suggestion could be an easy way for a student to participate, even if they can't think of new ideas to add to the rubric.

Lastly, students will be assessed in 2 ways on each project they submit.  They will use the class-created rubric to self-evaluate their project, and the teacher will use the rubric to evaluate them as well.  Both, this evaluation demonstrating that they considered the harm their project could cause and the teacher's evaluation actually grading them on how productive their project will be in society will be part of the final grade on each project.

### Outcomes

This plan should help students who are in the class to become more aware of all the ways that computing matters to so much more than the people trying to make money from it.  This plan should help students to learn about inclusivity and become more aware of hidden biases that they may be holding.  They will begin with this foundation so that every project they consider doing will be more positive and inclusive than if they had not previously studied these things.  No one is perfect, and students will learn that different people take very different opinions and approaches, but even understanding that will help them to approach others with more open-mindedness and humility, acknowledging that there may not be a 'right' opinion on some matters, but a complex array of impact.

Hopefully this allows more students to feel welcome and excited about joining the class because they will know that many different views will be considered and evaluated.
