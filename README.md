# Impacts on Society

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Students will be able to identify and name positive and negative impacts of computing in society including harm/health and inclusivity.

Students will create a rubric with which their own class' designs will be assessed.

Students will compare and contrast classmates proposals in light of the class rubric, and will reflect on their own designs to make them both inclusive and a positive impact in the world.

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?
Students will work together through research and class discussion to create a rubric of positivity that each student will be able to reference as they create or design projects.  This rubric will serve to allow students to self-reflect on their own work, and provide a set of central values that the class holds regarding inclusivity and impacts of what computer scientists do.  This will be a one time activity at the beginning of the course after students have been introduced to positive and negative things computing has had a hand in doing.




### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
