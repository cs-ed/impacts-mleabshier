# Impacts on Society

**Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course**

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

* Students will be able to identify and name positive and negative impacts of computing in society including harm/health and inclusivity.

* Students will critique their own work and the work of others in light of the above topics.

* Students will create projects that adhere to positive world impacts.

### Learning Activities

**Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?**

After learning about inclusivity, direct harms (like cyberbullying) and indirect harms (like incentivizig addictions) students will take an assessment as needed asking them to identify some of the positive and negative types of influences from computing.

Students will work together through research and class discussion to create a rubric of ideals that each student will be able to reference as they create or design projects.  This rubric will serve to allow students to self-reflect on their own work, and provide a set of central values that the class holds regarding inclusivity and impacts of what computer scientists do.  

This will be a one time activity at the beginning of the course after students have been introduced to some of the positive and negative things computing has had a hand in doing.  However, if the class learns more throughout the course, or comes up with things that should have been included, or are vague about the rubric, the class can revisit it, or individual students can create their own edited copy for personal use.

After the rubric is created, students will apply their rubric to some common apps and implementations.  After grading them individually, students will pair up and defend or change their positions and then as a class, pairs will share their results to see how different they all were.  This can be a great activity to reinforce the fact that different people will see different things, and that we should get feedback from many different sources to make sure we have seen all the perspectives.  This can also be an opportunity for students to discuss bias, and what kinds of biases different types of people might have.

After each project the students create, they will be encouraged to rate themselves against the rubric that the class has made.  They can include a reflection or self-assessment with their projects. Part of the points from each project will come from its rating on the class rubric.

### Assessment

Students' progress toward the goals will be graded in a few different ways.  They will be given a test/quiz grade based on the assessment, to make sure that everyone understood the general foundation of impact goals for the class.

For the creation of the rubric, students will not be graded, but different ways to encourage full participation will be employed.  Using think-pair-share, more students will be able to share suggestions, even if many of them have the same ideas within their pairs.  Random name drawing could also be employed to get more students talking.  Some lower level topics, such as saying a complement or criticism of another students suggestion could be an easy way for a student to participate, even if they can't think of new ideas to add to the rubric.

### Outcomes

**Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.**
